* Title of project
	* RSHELL

* What app do you plan to work on? 
	* A basic shell interface in which a user can enter various commands that execute certain functions.

* Why is it important and interesting?
	* Shell interfaces are what allow programmers to execute commands simply by writing text in the terminal. This can be an extremely powerful and time-saving tool for the savvy user. As computer science students, we use the terminal everyday and it would be very interesting to learn how it works and is implemented.

* What language/tools/technology you plan to use?
	* C++ with the C++ standard library.
	* Note: We need to learn about design patterns before we know which ones we will use and how we are going to implement them.

* What will be the input/output of your project?
	* The input of this project will be a command in the form of a string from the user, such as “$ ls -a; echo hello && mkdir test || echo world; git status”. The output will be the execution of these commands in order.
